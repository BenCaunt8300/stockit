# stockit


This is a project ive been working on in my spare time the past 3 weeks 

The goal is to eventually get the program to work with something like robinhood or stockpile in order to buy and sell stocks (stonks)
in real time 

stockit_class_sklearn.py has a class that is the regressor that uses polynomial regression
 
stockit_main.py takes real time data from yahoo and with a theoretical $50k and buys as much theoretical stock as it can with it 

it will then use data from yahoo to buy and sell that particular stock before it predicts a climb or a fall in stock price
